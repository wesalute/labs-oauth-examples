# WeSalute Brand Connections Demos

This application shows examples of hypothetical partner websites connecting to WeSalute using OAuth2 protocol.

Once connected, the same applications are able to access data about a WeSalute user.

## Installation

You will need a Node.js runtime installed locally.

- Clone this repositor
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` (for WeSalute teams) OR  `npm run prod` (for partner teams)
- Open http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser (do not use http://localhost:4000 - it is not whitelisted with the IDP)

You will need a valid WeSalute account to log in. Ask for a test one if it was not provided to you.

To view and revoke brand connections for your account see https://account.wesalute.com/brand-connections
